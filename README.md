# R U Being Served?

## Problem 
Every few years billboards appear saying “Vote for Me” and representatives for councils and health boards are voted into office, but do they represent us?

How do we know what they are discussing, or even if they attend meetings?

Are they discussing the important emerging topics
- The climate emergency  
- Mental health  
- Water quality and supply  
- Energy availability  

What are they doing to address these?

We could go to a meeting, watch it streamed online, read the minutes, or rely on the news to tell us, but is there a way that technology can help?

## Solution Overview

Meeting schedules and minutes for 2019 were scraped to produce tables of meetings and councillor attendances. The meeting text was also analysed to produce word counts for a set of meetings.

The attendance information was visualised for each organisation, and the word counts turned into word clouds and used for trend analysis of words found in the minutes over time.

Mapping layers from stats have been used to provide the initial landing page and navigation, and councillor photos are used in the attendance visualisation.

## Technology Used
